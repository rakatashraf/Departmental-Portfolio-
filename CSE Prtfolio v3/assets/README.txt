Place the provided BAUET crest image in this folder and name it exactly: bauet-logo.png

Path (relative to project root): assets/bauet-logo.png

If you downloaded the logo from the attachments in the editor, save it into this path so the navbar will use it automatically.

Notes:
- Recommended size: square image ~256x256 or larger; the page will display it at 56x56 pixels.
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG. Prefer PNG for transparent backgrounds.
- Example (Windows PowerShell):
  # Move the downloaded file to the assets folder and rename
  Move-Item -Path C:\Users\User\Downloads\bauet-logo.png -Destination .\assets\bauet-logo.png

If you want me to also copy/convert the embedded attachment into the repo, allow me to create a binary file here and I'll store it at the same path.
